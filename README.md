# TrekBag

TrekBag is a simple yet efficient React app designed to help travelers create, manage, and organize a to-do list of essential items they need to pack. Whether you're preparing for a short trip or a long journey, TrekBag makes it easy to track what you’ve packed and what’s left to take. The app leverages local storage to save the list persistently, so users can return to it anytime.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Easily add items you need to pack.
- **Mark as Packed or Unpacked**: Toggle items as "packed" or "unpacked" with a single click.
- **Sort Items**: By default, packed and unpacked items are sorted separately for easy viewing.
- **Persistent Storage**: TrekBag uses local storage to save the list, ensuring your items are retained even after refreshing the page.
